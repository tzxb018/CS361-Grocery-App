## Overview of Application
<details><summary>Login</summary>
 
![Grociri-login page](grociri-login.png)

When first opening the application, the user will be prompted to this login page. Here, the user can input their email and password to login. If incorrect credentials are given, the user will be prompted in the login window and will have to try again. If the user wants to create an account with a new email and password, they can select 'create a new account' and follow the prompts given there.
 </p>
</details>
<details><summary>User Menu</summary>
 
![Grociri-main page](grociri-user-menu.png)

After successfully logging in, the user will see their saved grocery lists. From here, they can select to view a grocery list by selecting 'view' in the corresponding row. To delete a list, they can select 'delete', which will delete the list and all the items in the list. Before deleting, the user will be asked to confirm their deletion of the list with an alert box. A user can search for a certain grocery list in the search bar by its name. To clear the search results, the user can press 'refresh'. Lastly, to create a new list, the user can select 'create new list', which will prompt them to a new page that has the user input the new list's name. After doing so, the user will be notified that the list was created and be brought back to this site.

<details><summary>Item List</summary>

After selecting a grocery list from the main page, the user will be prompted to this page. Here, they can see all the items saved in the list. They have the option of adding, searching for, and deleting the items in the list. All the functionalities are the same as the main page.

## How to Run Code
To run our project, git clone this repo onto your local machine. From there, open the project on Visual Studio (2019) and run the project. You should be prompted with the login page of our site. If you get an SQL exception telling you to wait, simply rerunning the project after a few seconds will solve it. Sometimes, since the Azure database is serverless, it takes a longer time to startup before the web application in order to unpause.
